## (b)

We center y to eliminate effects of intercepts. Set fit_intercept to false to make bound of loss function is not effected by intercepts.

To avoid data snooping so that we can apply Hoeffding inequality and make our generalization error valid.

## (c)

no regularization: val_MSE = 1.596
l1 regularization: lambda = 0.03125 val_MSE = 1.5927
l2 regularization: lambda = 1024    val_MSE = 1.5934

## (d)

min_samples = 0.98

max_trials=100

residual_threshold=0.23

val_MSE = 0.6427

RANSAC outperforms than other linear regression methods, maybe because there are many outlier data points in dataset and make linear regression overfit.

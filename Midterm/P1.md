## (b)

We center y to eliminate effects of intercepts. Set fit_intercept to false to make bound of loss function is not effected by intercepts. Also, center y can make MSE in a relativly small range.

To avoid data snooping so that we can apply Hoeffding inequality and make our generalization error valid.

## (c)

no regularization: val_MSE = 1.596
l1 regularization: lambda = 0.03125 val_MSE = 1.5927
l2 regularization: lambda = 1024    val_MSE = 1.5934

## (d)

min_samples = 0.98

max_trials=100

residual_threshold=0.23

val_MSE = 0.6427

RANSAC outperforms than other linear regression methods, maybe because there are many outlier data points in dataset and make linear regression overfit.
